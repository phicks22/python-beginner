# Fundamentals of Python (some of them)

## Installing things
You'll need an IDE that can use Jupyter notebook and Conda for this.

#### IDE
A good IDE that I use is VSCode. Follow the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to download.

#### Conda
Conda is a package manager that allows you to create virtual environments that contain modules that you need to use for a specific repository. This prevents dependency errors and conflicting package versions.

To install conda, go [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and follow the instructions.

# Download my repository
Open your terminal and move to the directory where you want this repository to live.

Example:
```bash
cd Documents/some_folder
```

Next, copy the repository address from my repository.

![Cloning](imgs/clone.png)

Run the following in the terminal (git clone + what you copied):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phicks22/python-beginner.git
```

You now have a copy of my repository on your local machine.

To open the code in VSCode do the following:
* File
* Open Folder
* Open python-beginner
